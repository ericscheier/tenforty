## `tenforty` - A python package for computing US taxes.

`tenforty` computes US federal taxes, and taxes for some but not all states that
have an income tax.

Provided you're comfortable with python, `tenforty` makes it convenient to
explore tax scenarios quickly.

For example, one can make a table or a plot that compares the taxes for a
married couple filing separately vs jointly.
